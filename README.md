## 🛠️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-storyteller.git
cd ai-storyteller
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

```sh
python -m venv storyteller_env

```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🏗️ Configuration

Before running the application, set up your **OpenAI API Key**.

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```sh
touch .env
```

2. Add the following line:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Alternatively, you can set the API key in your terminal:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here  # Mac/Linux
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here  # Windows
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

Run the application using Streamlit:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📦 Deploying to Hugging Face Spaces

1. Create a new **Hugging Face Space** with **Streamlit** as the SDK.
2. Upload your project files (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`, etc.).
3. Add a `requirements.txt` file with dependencies:

```
streamlit
langchain
openai
dotenv
```

4. Push your code:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push
```

5. Your Hugging Face Space will automatically build and deploy!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure all dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **API Key Errors**: Double-check that your OpenAI API key is correctly set in `.env` or your environment variables.
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Create a clean virtual environment and reinstall dependencies.
